A student management system (software) project is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based Python script and executable that allows the administrator to enter student data into a database and export the data to a CSV file. In this project, I utilised Tkinter for the graphical user interface, PyMySQL for database and query creation, PIL for picture loading, Pandas to convert the data to a CSV file, time to define the time, and date and as well as ttkthemes for the button themes.


## Requirements For `.py` File  
* Tkinter
* PIL
* TTKthemes
* PyMySQL
* Pandas
* Time
* MySQL


## Requirements For `.exe` File

* MySQL

## Prerequisites
- **MySQL Database**: Ensure that MySQL is installed and configured.

- Additionally, it's necessary to have a local server environment such as **XAMPP or Laragon with PHPMyAdmin** for database management.


## Installation

* Download `.rar` file from the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/Leon24k/FinalProject-AdvancedProgramming/releases/tag/v1.0)
```bash
  Extract and run the main.py file
```

### Installation Process :
<p align="justify">If you want to do this project then fork this project or clone using the following command :

    git clone https://github.com/Leon24k/FinalProject-AdvancedProgramming

**Please Make Sure** : The Mysql database should be installed. The following python modules should be installed mentioned below the introduction.

**To Install the Python Module** : Use the following command

    pip install pillow
 <br />
 

    pip install tkcalendar

## Note

* MySQL is needed to run the Python script and executable file.

* Set up a connection on MySQL before running it.

* Simply clone the repo and run the "main.py" file, and for executables, download from releases and run the .exe file.

* For connecting databases, the host name, username, and password are the same as for a MySQL connection.

* For logging in, Username - `admin` and Password - `admin@123`
